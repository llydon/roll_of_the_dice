# roll_of_the_dice
A dice roll simulator. A project to try out more Flutter.

## Description
This application generates a number based off the type of dice picked by the user to simulate a dice roll.\
User can currently pick either a 6-sided dice, a 12-sided dice, or a 20-sided dice.\
Could be used for game play, statistics, etc.\
Will try to add animation for dice next.\
